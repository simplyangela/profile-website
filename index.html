            <p>Hi everyone! My name is Angela. I currently just graduated from Baruch College with a major in Operations Management and minor in Information Technology and Social Responsibility & Business Law. One of my favorite attributes of Baruch College is the opportunity to network and become friends with a diverse group of hardworking people through classes, group projects, clubs, as well as through various professional and social events.  </p>

        <div class="side column">
            <p>What peaked my interest in learning how to code in the first place was through a program called "Girls who Code." Which is actually a program my younger sister attended during the summer of her senior year. At the end of the summer, my sister and her group presented a project they worked on throughout the summer term at their program graduation/showcase. Proudly, my sister invited my mom and I to attend her program graduation to view and experience the various projects created by her class. The project my sister's group created was a simple game where the user would use the keyboard arrows to move the character that represented trash across a city enviornment into the trash can goal. The main purpose of this project was to promote disposing one's litter into trash bins to ensure a cleaner city enviornment.One of the main challenges within the mini game was moving the avatar throughout the game with the arrow keys because every time the character switched directions, the arrows keys would shift directions as well. Another challenge players would face was the drop from the platform into the trash can goal because each time the game resets the location of the trash can and its size would also randomly change. What fascinated me most about coding throughout this experience was the endless possibilities and creativity that one could create through the power of coding. </p>

            <p> Currently, my experience with coding would include one semester of basic C++ through an Object Oriented-Programming course, one day of Introduction to HTML and CSS and one and a half weeks of Inclusion.
